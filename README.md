## Inspiration
If you’re a gamer, you can’t buy consoles or graphics cards right now in this crazy market 
It’s so bad that bots are required to even figure out when a GPU is in stock
You can’t buy anything on Black Friday or Cyber Monday due to high demand

## What it does
1. The bot checks if the item is in stock
2. If the item is in stock, the bot presses the button to add to cart
3. The bot navigates to the cart and presses the button to proceed to checkout
4. The bot opts to continue as guest
5. The bot fills out the contact information in the next page
6. The bot fills out the credit card information in the last page and then presses the button to place the order


Disclaimer: Steps 4 to 6 don’t work yet due to anti-bot measures from Best Buy

## How we built it
We split the team into parts. A few people were going to do the backend web scraping, a few people were doing the guy
## Challenges we ran into
Best Buy has bot blockers if you use the bot too much. A bit of our project doest work cuz of the the bot blocker
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It can click buttons in the webpage without human interference
## What we learned
How to scrape the web
## What's next for Best Buy Bot
1. Circumvent the anti-bot measures on Best Buy
2. Add support for paying with PayPal
3. Add support for buying from other websites like Amazon, Newegg, AMD.com, etc.
4. Make the GUI more user-friendly
5. Also notify the users when the item is in stock and when the item is in the cart
